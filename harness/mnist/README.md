## Simple Plaintext Feed-Forward Model for MNIST Classification

The directory `harness/mnist` contains PyTorch code to train and test a basic feed-forward neural network for the MNIST digit classification task. The model is designed to be relatively small but achieves an accuracy above 95% on the test dataset.

### Getting Started

To run the code, you'll first need to install the necessary Python packages. It uses the `torch` and `torchvision` modules, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

1. **Install dependencies:** It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the script:**

```
python3 harness/mnist/mnist.py
```

**How it works**

The `mnist.py` script automatically handles model training and testing:

* **First Run:** When you run the script for the first time, it will train a new model on the MNIST dataset, save the trained weights to `mnist_ffnn_model.pth`, and evaluate it on the test data.

* **Subsequent Runs:** If `mnist_ffnn_model.pth` already exists in the directory, the script will skip the training phase and instead load the pre-trained model directly from the file.

**Example output**

**Rebuilding the Model**

If you wish to re-train the model from scratch (e.g., after making changes to the network architecture or training parameters), simply delete the `mnist_ffnn_model.pth` file and run the script again.
